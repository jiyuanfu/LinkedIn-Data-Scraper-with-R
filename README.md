# LinkedIn-Data-Scraper-with-R
LinkedIn Data Scraper
 
Goal of the project: 

This project aims to help HR quickly obtain candidates' resume information to proceed to the next interview process. Because it is very inefficient to manually query the LinkedIn profile of each job candidate, the work efficiency of HR is slowed down. The project will create a module in R with a Shiny interface that scrapes the LinkedIn resume information into a data file as text given a list of names. The tool will help HR get candidates' LinkedIn resume easily.
